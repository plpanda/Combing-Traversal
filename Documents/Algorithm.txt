Combing Traversal Algorithm: V3
Given a graph G, and initial k outer nodes to start with.

Initialize k empty sets for k combing nodes.

while (Traversal from all combing nodes are not stopped):
	//A single pass
	
	for all combing nodes as 'i':
		visit the 'i'th node
		
		Find all the unvisited neibours of 'i'
		
		if there are unvistited nodes:
			Randomly choose any of them to visit next as 'i'th node.
			Push the rest of them to 'i'th set.
			
		else
			Pick one unvisited node from the 'i'th set
			and mark it to visit next as 'i'th node.
			
			if there are no un-visited nodes in the 'i'th set
				Stop traversal for the 'i'th combing node.
